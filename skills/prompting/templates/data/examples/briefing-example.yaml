context:
  summary: We are investigating rate limiting implementations for our API gateway to prevent abuse while maintaining good user experience.
  background: |
    The current system has no rate limiting, leading to occasional abuse.
    We need a solution that balances security with usability.
    Budget allows for either custom implementation or managed service.
  constraints:
    - Must support 10,000 requests/second at peak
    - Cannot add more than 5ms latency
    - Must work with existing Redis infrastructure

task:
  description: Research adaptive rate limiting algorithms and provide recommendations for our use case.
  questions:
    - What are the most effective adaptive rate limiting algorithms?
    - What are the tradeoffs between token bucket, leaky bucket, and sliding window?
    - How do major cloud providers implement rate limiting?
  deliverables:
    - Summary of top 3 algorithms with pros/cons
    - Recommendation for our specific constraints
    - Implementation complexity estimate
